# Requirement : 

write a Flowchart program to : 

calculate circle area inscribed in a square then print it on the screen.

$$


{Area} = \frac{\pi \cdot A  ^2}{4} 



$$

the user should enter 
- A 

Area =(PI * A * A) / 4 

# Solution : 

```mermaid
graph TD

    A(Start) --> B[/Read A/]

    B --> C[PI = 3.14<br>Area = PI * A * A / 4]

    C --> D[/Print Area/]

    D --> E(End)
```
