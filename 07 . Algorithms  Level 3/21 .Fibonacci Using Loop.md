- Write a program to <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 31)">print Fibonacci Numbers</span> : 
- the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;


void PrintFibonacciUsingLoop(short Number)
{
	int FebNumber = 0;
	int Prev2 = 0, Prev1 = 1;
	cout << "1 ";
	for (short i = 2; i <= Number; ++i)
	{
		FebNumber = Prev1 + Prev2;
		cout << FebNumber << " ";
		Prev2 = Prev1;
		Prev1 = FebNumber;
	}
}


int main()
{

	PrintFibonacciUsingLoop(10);


	system("pause>0");
}

```

# ```cpp


#### Code Explanation & Algorithm Flow:

**Algorithm Flow:**
1. **Setup**: Initialize variables to track previous two Fibonacci numbers
2. **First Number**: Print "1" as the first Fibonacci number
3. **Loop Generation**: Calculate and print remaining Fibonacci numbers
4. **Update Variables**: Shift values for next iteration

**How the Code Works:**

1. **`PrintFibonacciUsingLoop(short Number)`**:
   - **Parameter**: `Number` specifies how many Fibonacci numbers to generate
   - **Initial Values**: 
     - `FebNumber = 0` (current Fibonacci number to be calculated)
     - `Prev2 = 0` (represents F(0) = 0, two positions back)
     - `Prev1 = 1` (represents F(1) = 1, one position back)
   - **Manual First Print**: `cout << "1 "` handles F(1) = 1

2. **Loop Logic** `for (short i = 2; i <= Number; ++i)`:
   - Starts from `i = 2` because F(1) is already printed
   - **Fibonacci Calculation**: `FebNumber = Prev1 + Prev2`
   - **Print Current**: Outputs the calculated Fibonacci number
   - **Variable Shifting**: 
     - `Prev2 = Prev1` (what was one back becomes two back)
     - `Prev1 = FebNumber` (current becomes one back)

**Key Algorithm Concepts:**
- **Sliding Window Technique**: Maintains only the two most recent values
- **Iterative Approach**: Uses loops instead of recursion for efficiency
- **Space Optimization**: O(1) space complexity, doesn't store all previous numbers
- **Sequential Generation**: Builds each number from the previous two

**Fibonacci Sequence Logic:**
```
F(1) = 1 (manually printed)
F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2  
F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
...and so on
```

**Variable Tracking Example** (for first few iterations):
- **Before loop**: Prev2=0, Prev1=1
- **i=2**: FebNumber=1+0=1, then Prev2=1, Prev1=1
- **i=3**: FebNumber=1+1=2, then Prev2=1, Prev1=2  
- **i=4**: FebNumber=2+1=3, then Prev2=2, Prev1=3

**Efficiency**: O(n) time complexity, much better than recursive approach which is O(2^n)
