#### Requirement : 

- Write a program that Transpose matrix

#### Solution : 


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;


void FillMatrixWithOrderedNumbers(int arr[3][3], short Rows, short
	Cols)
{
	short Counter = 0;

	for (short i = 0; i < Rows; i++)
	{
		for (short j = 0; j < Cols; j++)
		{
			Counter++;
			arr[i][j] = Counter;
		}
	}
}

void PrintMatrix(int arr[3][3], short Rows, short Cols)
{
	for (short i = 0; i < Rows; i++)
	{
		for (short j = 0; j < Cols; j++)
		{
			cout << " " << arr[i][j] << " ";
		}
		cout << "\n";
	}
}


void TransposeMatrix(int arr[3][3], int arrTransposed[3][3], short
	Rows, short Cols)
{
	for (short i = 0; i < Rows; i++)
	{
		for (short j = 0; j < Cols; j++)
		{
			arrTransposed[i][j] = arr[j][i];
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	int arr[3][3], arrTransposed[3][3];

	FillMatrixWithOrderedNumbers(arr, 3, 3);

	cout << "\nThe following is a 3x3 ordered matrix:\n";

	PrintMatrix(arr, 3, 3);

	TransposeMatrix(arr, arrTransposed, 3, 3);

	cout << "\n\nThe following is the transposed matrix:\n";

	PrintMatrix(arrTransposed, 3, 3);


	system("pause>0");
}

```



#### Code Explanation & Algorithm Flow:

**Algorithm Flow:**
1. **Matrix Setup**: Create original and transposed matrices
2. **Fill Original**: Populate first matrix with ordered numbers
3. **Display Original**: Show the initial matrix
4. **Transpose Operation**: Create transposed version
5. **Display Transposed**: Show the final transposed matrix

**How the Code Works:**

1. **Setup Functions** (Same as previous):
   - `FillMatrixWithOrderedNumbers()`: Creates ordered matrix (1-9)
   - `PrintMatrix()`: Displays matrix in formatted output

2. **`TransposeMatrix(int arr[3][3], int arrTransposed[3][3], short Rows, short Cols)`**:
   - **Key Algorithm**: Swaps rows and columns
   - **Critical Assignment**: `arrTransposed[i][j] = arr[j][i]`
   - **Index Swapping**: Source `[j][i]` becomes destination `[i][j]`
   - Uses nested loops to process each element
   - **Creates New Matrix**: Doesn't modify original, creates separate transposed matrix

**Key Algorithm Concepts:**
- **Matrix Transposition**: Flips matrix along main diagonal
- **Index Transformation**: `(i,j)` position becomes `(j,i)` position
- **Row-Column Swap**: Rows of original become columns of transposed
- **Separate Storage**: Uses two different matrices to preserve original

**Mathematical Transformation:**
```
Original Matrix:      Transposed Matrix:
1 2 3                 1 4 7
4 5 6        →        2 5 8
7 8 9                 3 6 9
```

**Index Mapping:**
- `arr[0][0] = 1` → `arrTransposed[0][0] = 1`
- `arr[0][1] = 2` → `arrTransposed[1][0] = 2`  
- `arr[0][2] = 3` → `arrTransposed[2][0] = 3`
- `arr[1][0] = 4` → `arrTransposed[0][1] = 4`
- And so on...

**Properties of Transpose:**
- Original dimensions m×n become n×m in transposed
- Main diagonal elements remain in same position
- Transpose of transpose equals original matrix
- For square matrices: rows become columns, columns become rows
