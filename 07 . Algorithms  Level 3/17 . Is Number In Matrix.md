- Write a program to<span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 31)"> check is number in the matrix</span> :

## Step-by-Step Algorithm Solution

### Algorithm: Check if Number Exists in Matrix

**Problem:** Determine if a specific number exists anywhere in the given matrix.

**Steps:**

#### Method 1: Using Count (Slower)
1. **Start** the algorithm
2. **Input:** Accept matrix, target number, rows, and columns
3. **Use** CountNumberInMatrix function to get total occurrences
4. **If** count > 0:
   - **Return** true (number exists)
5. **Else**:
   - **Return** false (number doesn't exist)
6. **End**

#### Method 2: Direct Search (Faster - Recommended)
1. **Start** the algorithm
2. **Input:** Accept matrix, target number, rows, and columns
3. **For each row i** from 0 to rows-1:
   - **For each column j** from 0 to columns-1:
     - **If** matrix[i][j] equals target number:
       - **Return** true immediately (early termination)
4. **If** loop completes without finding the number:
   - **Return** false
5. **End** the algorithm

**Time Complexity:** 
- Method 1: Always O(n×m) - checks all elements
- Method 2: Best O(1), Average O(n×m/2), Worst O(n×m)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) for both methods

**Key Points:**
- Method 2 is more efficient because it uses early termination
- Once the number is found, no need to check remaining elements
- Method 1 always scans the entire matrix even after finding the number
- For existence checking, Method 2 is preferred
- For counting occurrences, Method 1 is necessary

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Use Method 2 for simple existence checks
- Use Method 1 only when you need the actual count
- Early termination can significantly improve average performance
