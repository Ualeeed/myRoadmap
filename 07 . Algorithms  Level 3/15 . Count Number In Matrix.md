## Step-by-Step Algorithm Solution

### Algorithm: Count Occurrences of a Number in Matrix

**Problem:** Count how many times a specific number appears in a given matrix.

**Steps:**
1. **Start** the algorithm
2. **Input:** 
   - Accept matrix dimensions (rows and columns)
   - Accept matrix elements
   - Accept the target number to count
3. **Initialize** counter to 0
4. **For each row i** from 0 to rows-1:
   - **For each column j** from 0 to columns-1:
     - **If** matrix[i][j] equals the target number:
       - **Increment** counter by 1
5. **Output** the final count
6. **End** the algorithm

**Time Complexity:** O(n×m) where n is rows and m is columns
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - only using a counter variable

**Key Points:**
- Algorithm checks every element in the matrix exactly once
- Works with any matrix size (not limited to square matrices)
- Counter starts from 0 and increments for each match found
- Can be used to count any integer value (positive, negative, or zero)
- Returns 0 if the number is not found in the matrix

**Example Trace:**
- Matrix: [[9,1,12], [0,9,1], [0,9,9]]
- Target: 9
- Found at positions: (0,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)
- Final count: 4
