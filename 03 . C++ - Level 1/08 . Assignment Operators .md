In C++, assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is the simple assignment operator (=).

### Simple Assignment (=):
Assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.

```c++
int a = 10; // Assigns 10 to a
int b = a;  // Assigns the value of a (10) to b
```

### Compound Assignment Operators:

These combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with an assignment. They are shorthand for performing an operation and then assigning the result back to the left-hand operand.

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to |     |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- | --- |
| =        | A = 5   | A = 5         |     |
| +=       | A += B  | A = A + B     |     |
| -=       | A -= B  | A = A - B     |     |
| *=       | A *= B  | A = A * B     |     |
| /=       | A /= B  | A = A / B     |     |
| %=       | A %= B  | A = A % B     |     |
| &=       | A &= B  | A = A & B     |     |
| ^=       | A ^= B  | A = A ^ B     |     |
| <<=      | A <<= B | A = A << B    |     |
| >>=      | A >>= B | A = A >> B    |     |

Ex :  

```c++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int A = 10, B = 20;

	A += B; // A = A + B   // A = 30 
	cout << "A = " << A << endl;

	A -= B; // A = A - B   // A = 10
	cout << "A = " << A << endl;

	A *= B; // A = A * B  // A = 200
	cout << "A = " << A << endl;

	A /= B; // A = A / B  // A = 10 
	cout << "A = " << A << endl;

	A %= B; // A = A % B  // A = 10
	cout << "A = " << A << endl;

	return 0;


}
```

### 1 . **Bitwise AND assignment (`&=`)**

- **Expression:** `A &= B`
    
- **Equivalent to:** `A = A & B`
    
- **What it does:**  
    Performs a **bitwise AND** on each bit of `A` with the corresponding bit of `B`, then stores the result back in `A`.
    
    - Each bit in the result is `1` only if **both** corresponding bits in `A` and `B` are `1`.
        

**Example:**

```cpp
int A = 6;   // binary: 0110
int B = 3;   // binary: 0011
A &= B;      // A = A & B  -> 0110 & 0011 = 0010 (2)
```

Result: `A` becomes `2`.

---

### 2 . **Bitwise XOR assignment (`^=`)**

- **Expression:** `A ^= B`
    
- **Equivalent to:** `A = A ^ B`
    
- **What it does:**  
    Performs a **bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)** and assigns back to `A`.
    
    - Each bit is `1` if the bits are **different**; `0` if they are the same.
        

**Example:**

```cpp
int A = 6;   // 0110
int B = 3;   // 0011
A ^= B;      // 0110 ^ 0011 = 0101 (5)
```

Result: `A` becomes `5`.

---

### 3 . **Left shift assignment (`<<=`)**

- **Expression:** `A <<= B`
    
- **Equivalent to:** `A = A << B`
    
- **What it does:**  
    Shifts all bits of `A` to the **left by B positions**, filling with zeros on the right.
    
    - This is like multiplying `A` by `2^B` (as long as it doesn’t overflow).
        

**Example:**

```cpp
int A = 3;   // 0011
int B = 2;
A <<= B;     // 0011 << 2 = 1100 (12)
```

Result: `A` becomes `12`.

---

### 4 . **Right shift assignment (`>>=`)**

- **Expression:** `A >>= B`
    
- **Equivalent to:** `A = A >> B`
    
- **What it does:**  
    Shifts all bits of `A` to the **right by B positions**.
    
    - For positive integers, this is roughly like integer division by `2^B`.
        

**Example:**

```cpp
int A = 16;  // 10000
int B = 2;
A >>= B;     // 10000 >> 2 = 00100 (4)
```

Result: `A` becomes `4`.

### Quick Table Recap

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`&=`|Bitwise AND and assign|
|`^=`|Bitwise XOR and assign|
|`<<=`|Left shift bits and assign|
|`>>=`|Right shift bits and assign|

These are **compound assignment operators**—they combine an operation and an assignment in one step, which is shorter and often more efficient.
### Special Assignment Operators:

*   **Copy Assignment Operator:** This is a special member function (`operator=`) that is called when an object is assigned the value of another existing object of the same class. If you don't define one, the compiler provides a default copy assignment operator that performs a member-wise copy. For classes with dynamically allocated memory, you often need to define your own to handle deep copies and prevent issues like double-freeing memory.

*   **Move Assignment Operator (C++11 onwards):** This is another special member function (`operator=`) that takes an rvalue reference (e.g., `MyClass&& other`). It's used for efficient transfer of resources from a temporary object (rvalue) to an existing object, avoiding unnecessary deep copies.
