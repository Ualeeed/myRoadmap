# **What is a Destructor?**

A **destructor** is a **special method** in a class that is **automatically called when an object is destroyed**.  
It is used to **release resources** or perform **cleanup** before the object goes out of scope.

- Has the **same name as the class**, preceded by a **tilde `~`**
    
- **No parameters**
    
- **No return type**
    
- Automatically called at the **end of an object’s lifetime**.


```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

  

class clsAddress

{

  

public :

    string FullName;

  

    //This is Instructor will be called when object is built.

    clsAddress()

    {

        cout << "\nHi i'm the instructor \n" << endl;

    }

  

    //This is destructor will be called when object is destroyed.

    ~clsAddress()

    {

        cout << "\nHi I'm the Destructor \n" << endl;

    }

};

void Fun1()

{

        clsAddress Person1;

        //after exiting from function, person1 will be destroyed and destructor will be called

}

  

void Fun2()

{

        clsAddress * Person2 = new clsAddress;

        //always use delete whenever you use new, otherwise object will remain in memory

        delete Person2;

}

  

int main()

{

    Fun1();

    Fun2();

  

    system("pause>0");

    return 0;

}
```

- **Automatic Cleanup**
    
    - No need to call destructor manually.
        
    - Useful to release memory, close files, or disconnect from databases.
        
- **One Destructor per Class**
    
    - Unlike constructors, destructors **cannot be overloaded**.
        
- **When Called**
    
    - When a local object goes **out of scope**
        
    - When a dynamically allocated object is **deleted**


| Feature        | Constructor        | Destructor                    |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Purpose        | Initialize object  | Cleanup before object is gone |
| Name           | Same as class      | ~ClassName                    |
| Parameters     | Can have           | None                          |
| Return type    | None               | None                          |
| Automatic call | On object creation | On object destruction         |
| Overloading    | Yes                | No                            |
