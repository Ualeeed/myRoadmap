## What is a **Friend Class** in C++?

Normally:

- `private` and `protected` members of a class cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
    
- Only the class itself (and its member functions) can access them.
    

But if you declare another class as a **friend**, that class gets **special permission** to access the private and protected members.

```cpp
class clsA
{
private:
    int _Var1;

protected:
    int _Var3;

public:
    int Var2;
    
    clsA()
    {
        _Var1 = 10;
        Var2 = 20;
        _Var3 = 30;
    }

    // this will grant access for everything to class B
    friend class clsB;   // friend class 
};
```

Here:

- `clsA` has:
    
    - `_Var1` → **private**
        
    - `_Var3` → **protected**
        
    - `Var2` → **public**
- Normally, `clsB` would **not** be able to see `_Var1` and `_Var3`.  
But because of this line:

```cpp
 friend class clsB;

```

`clsB` is declared as a **friend** of `clsA`.  
This means `clsB` can **access private and protected members** of `clsA`.

Implementation in <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">clsB</span> : 

```cpp
class clsB
{
public:
    void display(clsA A1)
    {
        cout << endl << "The value of Var1=" << A1._Var1 ;
        cout << endl << "The value of Var2=" << A1.Var2  ;
        cout << endl << "The value of Var3=" << A1._Var3 ;
    }
};
```

- Normally, accessing `A1._Var1` and `A1._Var3` would be a **compiler error** (because they are private and protected).
    
- But since `clsB` is a **friend** of `clsA`, this is **allowed** ✅.

## Key Points About Friend Class

1. A friend class can access **private and protected members** of another class.
    
2. Friendship is **not mutual**:
    
    - If `clsA` is a friend of `clsB`, it does **not** mean `clsB` is a friend of `clsA`.
        
    - You need to declare it both ways if you want two-way friendship.
        
3. Friendship is **not inherited**:
    
    - If `clsB` inherits from `clsA`, it doesn’t automatically gain access to `clsA`'s friends.
        
4. Used when two classes need **tight cooperation** and should be allowed to look into each other’s private data.
