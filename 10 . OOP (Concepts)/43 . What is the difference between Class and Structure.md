##  Key Differences Between `struct` and `class` (in C++)

1. **Keyword**
    
    - `struct` → Declared using the keyword `struct`.
        
    - `class` → Declared using the keyword `class`.
        
2. **Default Access Modifier**
    
    - `struct` → Members are **public** by default.
        
    - `class` → Members are **private** by default.
        
3. **Purpose / Usage**
    
    - `struct` → Mainly for **grouping simple data** together (like a record).
        
    - `class` → For **data abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance** (object-oriented programming).
        
4. **Type (Memory)**
    
    - In **C++**, both `struct` and `class` are **reference types** and stored on heap/stack depending on how you create them.
        
    - ⚠️ But in **C#**,
        
        - `struct` = **Value Type** (stored on stack).
            
        - `class` = **Reference Type** (stored on heap).
            
5. **Constructors**
    
    - `struct` → Usually has limited constructor support. In C++ you can define constructors, but by default, structs are often used without them.
        
    - `class` → Can have **all types of constructors** (default, parameterized, copy, move).
        
6. **Inheritance**
    
    - `struct` → Supports inheritance, but rarely used for that.
        
    - `class` → Inheritance is a **core feature** (base class, derived class, polymorphism).

##  When to Use `struct` vs `class`

 **Use `struct` when**:

- You just want to group related **data fields** (like a simple container).
    
- Example: coordinates, RGB colors, student record with only data.
    

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

 **Use `class` when**:

- You want to implement **object-oriented programming** (OOP).
    
- You need **encapsulation**, **methods**, **inheritance**, or **polymorphism**.
    
- Example: A full object with behavior.
    

```cpp
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
public:
    Student(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
    void printInfo() { cout << name << " " << age; }
};
```

 **Summary:**

- Think of `struct` as a **lightweight container for data**.
    
- Think of `class` as a **blueprint for objects with data + behavior**.
