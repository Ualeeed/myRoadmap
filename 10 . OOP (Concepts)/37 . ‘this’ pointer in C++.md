### 1. What is `this` in C++?

- `this` is a **pointer** that automatically exists inside every **non-static member function** of a class.
    
- It points to the object that is calling the functions


- Example : 

```cpp

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;

class clsEmployee 

{

public:
    int ID;     
    string Name; 
    float Salary;

    clsEmployee (int ID, string Name, float Salary)
    {
       this->ID = ID;
       this->Name = Name;
       this->Salary = Salary;

    }

    static void Func1(clsEmployee Employee)
    {

        Employee.Print();

    }

    void Func2()

    {
        Func1( *this );


    }

    void Print()
    {
        cout << ID << "  " << Name << "  " << Salary << endl;
      // cout << this->ID << "  " << this->Name << "  " << this->Salary << endl;
       
    }

};

int main(void) 

{
    clsEmployee Employee1 (101, "Ali", 5000); 
    Employee1.Print();

    Employee1.Func2();

    return 0;
}

```


- Why using "this->" is needed in certain cases ? 

```cpp
clsEmployee Employee1(101, "Ali", 5000);
Employee1.Print();   // inside Print(), "this" points to Employee1
```

- So, in our constructor:

```cpp
clsEmployee(int ID, string Name, float Salary) {
    this->ID = ID;
    this->Name = Name;
    this->Salary = Salary;
}
```

- `this->ID` means "the ID of the object being constructed".
    
- If you just wrote `ID = ID;`, the **parameter `ID` would hide the member `ID`**, so you’d just be assigning the parameter to itself.
    
- That’s why `this->` is needed here.

### When do you need `this`?

✅ You **must** use `this` when:

- A parameter or local variable has the same name as a member variable (to avoid shadowing).
    
- You want to return the current object (`return *this;` is common in operator overloading or method chaining).
    
- You want to explicitly pass the current object to another function (`Func1(*this);`).
    

❌ You **don’t need** `this` when:

- Accessing members in a function with no name conflict (`cout << Name;` works fine).
    
- It’s obvious which variable you’re using.

### 3. How do `static` functions work?

A `static` function inside a class:

- **Does not belong to an object**, it belongs to the class itself.
    
- **Cannot use `this`**, because `this` only exists inside object context.
    
- Can only access **static members** of the class directly.  
    (Non-static members require an object to be passed in.)

- In our code:

```cpp
 static void Func1(clsEmployee Employee) {
   Employee.Print();
 }
```

- `Func1` is static, so it cannot access `Name`, `Salary`, etc. directly, because those belong to an object.
    
- That’s why it takes a parameter (`clsEmployee Employee`) and then calls `Employee.Print()`.

### 4. Connection between `this` and static

In our code:

```cpp
 void Func2() {
   Func1(*this);
 }

```

Here:

- `Func2` is a **normal member function**, so it has a `this` pointer.
    
- `*this` dereferences that pointer, creating a reference to the current object.
    
- That object is passed into the static `Func1`.
    

So the flow is:

1. `Employee1.Func2()` is called.
    
2. Inside `Func2`, `*this` = `Employee1`.
    
3. It calls `Func1(Employee1)`.
    
4. `Func1` then calls `Employee1.Print()`.

```ad-check
title: ✅ Summary

- Use `this` when you need to refer to the current object explicitly (name conflict, return `*this`, or passing object).
    
- Don’t use it when accessing members is unambiguous.
    
- `static` functions don’t have `this`, they work at the **class level**, not the object level.
    
- To use object data in a `static` function, you must pass an object (like your `Func1` does).
```
