```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class clsPerson
{

public:

  virtual  void Print()
    
  {
        cout << "Hi, i'm a person!\n ";
    
  }

};

class clsEmployee : public clsPerson
{
public:
    void Print()
    {
        cout << "Hi, I'm an Employee\n";
    }
};

class clsStudent : public clsPerson
{
public:
     void Print() 
    {
        cout << "Hi, I'm a student\n";
    }
};


int main()

{

    clsEmployee Employee1;
    clsStudent  Student1;
    //Early-Static Binding: at compilation time
    Employee1.Print();
    Student1.Print();

    clsPerson * Person1 = &Employee1;
    clsPerson * Person2 = &Student1;
    
    //Late-Dynamic Binding: at runtime
    Person1->Print();
    Person2->Print();


    system("pause>0");
    return 0;
}
```

## **Static (Early) Binding**

- Happens **at compile time**.
    
- The <span style="color:rgb(20, 192, 255)">compiler</span> already knows which function to call, because the object type is known explicitly.
- In Our code:

```cpp
 Employee1.Print();
 Student1.Print();
```


Here, the <span style="color:rgb(20, 192, 255)">compiler</span> knows `Employee1` is of type `clsEmployee` and `Student1` is of type `clsStudent`, so it directly binds to their `Print()` implementations without checking at runtime.

## **Dynamic (Late) Binding**

- Happens **at runtime**.
    
- The function call is resolved **based on the actual object being pointed to**, not the type of the pointer.
    
- Enabled by the `virtual` keyword in the base class.
- In Our code : 

```cpp
clsPerson * Person1 = &Employee1;
clsPerson * Person2 = &Student1;

Person1->Print();   // Resolved at runtime → "Hi, I'm an Employee"
Person2->Print();   // Resolved at runtime → "Hi, I'm a student"

```

- Here, even though both `Person1` and `Person2` are declared as `clsPerson*`, the program checks **at runtime** which actual object they point to (Employee or Student) and calls the correct overridden function.

**Summary:**

- **Static/Early Binding** = compiler decides (fast, but fixed).
    
- **Dynamic/Late Binding** = runtime decides (flexible, polymorphism).
