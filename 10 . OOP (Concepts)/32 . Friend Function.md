## What is a Friend Function?

- Normally, **private** and **protected** members of a class cannot be accessed from outside.
    
- A **friend function** is a **normal function** (not a class member) that is given special access rights to a class.
    
- It is declared inside the class with the keyword `friend`.

```cpp
class clsA
{
private:
    int _Var1;

protected:
    int _Var3;

public:
    int Var2;
    
    clsA()
    {
        _Var1 = 10;
        Var2 = 20;
        _Var3 = 30;
    }
   
    friend int MySum(clsA A1);    // friend function declaration
};

```

Here:

- `MySum` is declared as a **friend function** of `clsA`.
    
- This means `MySum` can access **private** (`_Var1`) and **protected** (`_Var3`) members of `clsA`.

##### Implementation of Friend Function : 

```cpp
// This is a normal function, NOT a member of clsA
int MySum(clsA A1)
{
    return A1._Var1 + A1.Var2 + A1._Var3 ;
}
```

Even though `_Var1` and `_Var3` are **not public**, `MySum` can access them because it’s declared as a **friend**.


Using It in `main` : 

```cpp
int main()
{
    clsA A1;
    cout << MySum(A1);   // Output: 60 (10 + 20 + 30)
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points About Friend Functions

1. **Not a class member** → It’s a normal function, but with special access.
    
2. Can access **private** and **protected** members.
    
3. Declared inside a class with `friend` keyword.
    
4. Friendship is **not mutual** (if `clsA` declares `MySum` as friend, it doesn’t mean the reverse).
    
5. Friendship is **not inherited**.
