# Class Members

Class members are the building blocks of a class that define its structure and behavior. They consist of two main categories: **Data Members** and **Member Functions** (also called Methods).

---

## 1. Data Members (Attributes/Properties)

Data members are variables declared inside a class that hold the state or data of an object. They represent the **characteristics or properties** of the class.

### Types of Data Members:

#### a) Instance Data Members
- Belong to each individual object
- Each object has its own copy
- Different values for different objects
- Allocated when an object is created

#### b) Static Data Members (Class Variables)
- Belong to the class itself, not to any specific object
- Shared by all instances of the class
- Only one copy exists for the entire class
- Useful for tracking information common to all objects (e.g., counting total objects)

#### c) Constant Data Members (const)
- Values cannot be changed after initialization
- Must be initialized when declared or in the constructor initializer list
- Can be instance-level or static

---

## 2. Member Functions (Methods)

Member functions are functions declared inside a class that define the **behavior or operations** that can be performed on the class data.

### Types of Member Functions:

#### a) Instance Member Functions
- Operate on instance data members
- Called on specific objects
- Have access to the `this` pointer
- Can access both static and non-static members

#### b) Static Member Functions
- Belong to the class, not to any specific object
- Can be called without creating an object
- Cannot access non-static members directly (no `this` pointer)
- Can only access static data members
- Called using `ClassName::functionName()`

#### c) Const Member Functions
- Promise not to modify the object's state
- Declared with `const` keyword after parameter list
- Can be called on const objects
- Good practice for functions that only read data

---

## Access Specifiers

Members can have different access levels:

- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere in the program
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class itself
- **Protected**: Accessible within the class and its derived classes

---

## Example: Comprehensive Demonstration

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class clsPerson
{
private:
    // Instance Data Members (each object has its own copy)
    string FirstName;
    string LastName;
    int Age;
    
    // Static Data Member (shared by all objects)
    static int PersonCount;
    
public:
    // Constructor
    clsPerson(string fName, string lName, int age)
    {
        FirstName = fName;
        LastName = lName;
        Age = age;
        PersonCount++;  // Increment count when object is created
    }
    
    // Instance Member Function - Getter
    string GetFirstName() const  // const means it won't modify the object
    {
        return FirstName;
    }
    
    // Instance Member Function - Setter
    void SetFirstName(string fName)
    {
        FirstName = fName;
    }
    
    // Instance Member Function - Returns full name
    string GetFullName() const
    {
        return FirstName + " " + LastName;
    }
    
    // Instance Member Function - Display info
    void DisplayInfo() const
    {
        cout << "Name: " << GetFullName() << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << Age << endl;
    }
    
    // Static Member Function - Returns total person count
    static int GetPersonCount()
    {
        return PersonCount;
    }
    
    // Destructor
    ~clsPerson()
    {
        PersonCount--;  // Decrement count when object is destroyed
    }
};

// Initialize static data member outside the class
int clsPerson::PersonCount = 0;

int main()
{
    // Creating objects
    clsPerson Person1("Mohammed", "Ahlidou", 25);
    clsPerson Person2("Ahmed", "Hassan", 30);
    
    // Accessing instance member functions
    cout << "Person 1: " << Person1.GetFullName() << endl;
    
    Person1.DisplayInfo();
    
    // Accessing static member function (can call without object)
    cout << "\nTotal persons created: " << clsPerson::GetPersonCount() << endl;
    
    // Can also call static function using an object (but not recommended)
    cout << "Total persons: " << Person2.GetPersonCount() << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts Summary

### Data Members:
- **Instance members**: Each object has its own copy (e.g., `FirstName`, `LastName`)
- **Static members**: One copy shared by all objects (e.g., `PersonCount`)
- **Const members**: Cannot be modified after initialization

### Member Functions:
- **Instance functions**: Operate on specific objects, have access to `this` pointer
- **Static functions**: Belong to the class, no `this` pointer, can only access static members
- **Const functions**: Promise not to modify object state

### Best Practices:
1. Make data members **private** to enforce encapsulation
2. Provide **public getter/setter** functions for controlled access
3. Use **const** for functions that don't modify the object
4. Use **static** for data/functions that are common to all objects
5. Use meaningful names: data members as nouns, functions as verbs

## Memory Allocation Note

- **Instance members**: Memory allocated for each object created
- **Static members**: Memory allocated once for the class (shared)
- **Member functions**: Code stored once, shared by all objects
