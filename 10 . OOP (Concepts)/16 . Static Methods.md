# **What is a Static Method?**

A **static method** is a **method that belongs to the class**, not to any specific object.

- Can be called **without creating an object**
    
- Can **only access static members** of the class
    
- Cannot access **non-static members** directly

|Feature|Static Method|Non-Static Method|
|---|---|---|
|Belongs to|Class|Object|
|Access static members|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Access non-static|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Call|ClassName::Method()|Object.Method()|
|Needs object?|❌ No|✅ Yes|
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class clsA 
{

public:

    static int Function1()
    {
        return 10;
    }

    int Function2()
    {
        return 20;
    }

};

int main()
{   
   
    //The following line calls static function directly via class no throught the object
    //At class level you can call only static methods and static members
    cout << clsA::Function1() <<endl;

    //static methods can also be called throught the object.
    clsA A1, A2;
    cout << A1.Function1() << endl;
    cout << A1.Function2() << endl;
    cout << A2.Function1() << endl;
   

}
```
