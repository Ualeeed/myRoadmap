# Requirement :

- Write a program that ask the user to enter his name then print the result on the screen.

# Solution :

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;


string ReadName()
{
	string Name;
	cout << "
 Enter your name : " << endl;
	getline(cin, Name);
	return Name;
}
void PrintName(string Name)
{
	cout << "
 Your name is : " << Name << endl;
}


int main()
{

	PrintName(ReadName());


}

```

# Explanation:

This C++ program is designed to ask for the user's name and then display it on the screen. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **`#include <iostream>` and `#include <string>`**: These lines include necessary libraries. `iostream` is for input/output operations (like `cout`), and `string` is for using the `string` data type.

2.  **`using namespace std;`**: This line allows us to use elements from the standard namespace (like `cout`, `cin`, `string`, `endl`) without having to write `std::` before them.

3.  **`ReadName()` function**:

    - It declares a `string` variable called `Name`.
    - It uses `cout` to print the message "Enter your name : " to the console, asking for user input.
    - `getline(cin, Name);` reads the full line of text that the user types and stores it in the `Name` variable. This is useful for names that contain spaces.
    - Finally, it returns the `Name` that was entered.

4.  **`PrintName(string Name)` function**:

    - This function takes one argument, a `string` called `Name`.
    - It uses `cout` to print the message "Your name is : " followed by the value of the `Name` variable passed to it.

5.  **`main()` function**:
    - This is the main entry point where the program execution begins.
    - Inside `main`, the line `PrintName(ReadName());` is a nested function call.
    - First, `ReadName()` is called. It prompts the user, gets the name, and returns it.
    - The returned name is then immediately used as the argument for the `PrintName()` function, which then prints the name to the screen.
