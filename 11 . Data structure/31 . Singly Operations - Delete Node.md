## Easy Explanation: How Deleting a Node Works

Think of a linked list like a chain of people holding hands. Each person (node) holds the hand of the next person in line.

**When we want to remove someone from the chain:**

1. **Check if the chain is empty** - If there's no one there, we can't delete anything!

2. **Is it the first person?** - If we're removing the person at the front:
   - Tell everyone that the second person is now the new leader
   - Let the first person go (free them from memory)

3. **Is it someone in the middle or end?** - We need to find them:
   - Walk through the chain looking for the person with the value we want to delete
   - Keep track of the person right before them (Previous)
   - Keep track of the current person we're checking (Current)

4. **Once we find them:**
   - Tell the previous person to hold hands with the next person (skip over the one we're deleting)
   - Let go of the person we wanted to remove (free them from memory)

5. **If we never find them** - They weren't in the chain to begin with, so we just stop looking

**In the code example:**
- We create a list: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
- We delete the node with value 4
- The result becomes: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 (4 is gone, and 3 now connects directly to 5)

The key is to always maintain the connections between nodes, like keeping the chain unbroken when someone leaves!
