## Easy Explanation: How Doubly Linked Lists Work

A **doubly linked list** is like a train where each car is connected to both the car in front AND the car behind it.

**The Difference from Regular (Singly) Linked Lists:**
- **Regular linked list**: You can only walk forward (like a one-way street)
- **Doubly linked list**: You can walk forward AND backward (like a two-way street)

**Each Node Has Three Parts:**
1. **value** - The data it stores (like a passenger in a train car)
2. **next** - A pointer to the next node (the car ahead)
3. **prev** - A pointer to the previous node (the car behind)

**In the Code Example:**

We create a doubly linked list with 3 nodes: 1 ↔ 2 ↔ 3

```
NULL ← [Node1: 1] ↔ [Node2: 2] ↔ [Node3: 3] → NULL
```

**How the connections work:**
- **Node1**: prev = NULL (nothing before it), next = Node2
- **Node2**: prev = Node1, next = Node3  
- **Node3**: prev = Node2, next = NULL (nothing after it)

**Why Use Doubly Linked Lists?**
- ✅ You can traverse in **both directions** (forward and backward)
- ✅ Easier to **delete** a node (you have access to the previous node directly)
- ✅ Useful for implementing features like "undo/redo" or browser back/forward buttons
- ❌ Takes more memory (stores two pointers instead of one)

Think of it like a photo carousel where you can swipe left or right - that's the power of a doubly linked list!
