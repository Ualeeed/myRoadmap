#### IF we have two function with O(n) are they have the same speed ? 



```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

short FindNumberAlgorhim1(short arr1[10] , short Number)

{
    int n = 10;
    short pos = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    {
        if (arr1[i] == Number)
        {
            pos= i;
        }
    }

    return pos;

}

short FindNumberAlgorhim2(short arr1[10], short Number)

{
    int n = 10;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    {
        if (arr1[i] == Number)
        {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
   
}

int main()
{
    short arr1[10] = { 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100 };

    cout << FindNumberAlgorhim1(arr1, 100) <<"\n";
    cout << FindNumberAlgorhim2(arr1, 100) << "\n";

    system("pause>0");
    return 0;
}
```


- The functions `(FindNumberAlgorhim 1 and FindNumberAlgorhim 2)` = O(n) but if the number who I'm looking for is tin the beginning or in middle of the `arr` the `FindNumberAlgorhim2` is faster that the `FindNumberAlgorhim1` because `FindNumberAlgorhim2` exit the loop when she found the index of the number in the other function it keep iterating even she found the number we are looking for , but if the number we are looking for is in the end of the `arr` the have the same speed as well.
