## What is the STL Library?


### Main Components of STL:
**STL** stands for **Standard Template Library** - it's a powerful collection of ready-to-use tools that come built into C++.

<span style="color:rgb(20, 192, 255)">Think of STL as a toolbox </span>that contains pre-made, tested, and optimized data structures and algorithms. Instead of building everything from scratch, you can just grab what you need from this toolbox.

1. **Containers** - These store your data
   - `stack` - Last-In-First-Out (like a stack of plates)
   - `queue` - First-In-First-Out (like a line at a store)
   - `vector` - Dynamic array that can grow
   - `list` - Doubly linked list
   - `map` - Key-value pairs
   - And many more!

2. **Algorithms** - These help you manipulate data
   - Sorting, searching, finding min/max, etc.

3. **Iterators** - These help you navigate through containers
   - Like pointers that let you move through your data

### Why Use STL?

- **Save Time**: No need to implement common data structures yourself
- **Reliable**: Tested by thousands of developers
- **Efficient**: Highly optimized for performance
- **Standard**: Works the same way across all C++ compilers

### How to Use STL:

Simply include the header file you need:
```cpp
#include <stack>   // for stacks
#include <vector>  // for vectors
#include <queue>   // for queues
#include <map>     // for maps
```

Then use the namespace:
```cpp
 using namespace std;
```

And you're ready to go! No need to write hundreds of lines of code - just use what STL provides.
