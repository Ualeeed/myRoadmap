# Sub Domain Names

## Definition
A *subdomain*  is an extra part added to the beginning of your main domain name to organize different sections of your website. It appears before the main domain name, separated by a dot.

## Structure Example
In the address: **blog.example.com**
- `blog` = Subdomain
- `example.com` = Main domain

## Common Examples

1. **www.example.com** - The most common subdomain for the main website
2. **blog.example.com** - A separate blog section
3. **shop.example.com** - An online store
4. **mail.example.com** - Email access
5. **support.example.com** - Customer service section

## Why Use Subdomains?

### Organization
- Helps organize large websites into clear sections
- Makes navigation easier for visitors
- Separates different types of content

### Functionality
- Each subdomain can work like a separate website
- Can have different designs and structures
- Can be hosted on different servers if needed

### Examples in Real Life
- A university might use: **engineering.university.edu** and **business.university.edu**
- A company might use: **store.company.com** for shopping and **help.company.com** for support

## Subdomain vs Subdirectory

**Subdomain**: blog.example.com (appears BEFORE the domain)
**Subdirectory**: example.com/blog (appears AFTER the domain)

Both organize content, but subdomains create more separation between sections.

## Creating Subdomains

- Subdomains don't cost extra money (included with your domain)
- You can create unlimited subdomains with most hosting plans
- Setup is done through your domain control panel
- Usually takes less than 24 hours to become active

## Key Points
