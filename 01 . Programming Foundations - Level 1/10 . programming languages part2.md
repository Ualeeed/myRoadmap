# <span style="color:rgb(20, 192, 255)">Programming Languages</span>

A **programming language** is a formal system used to **give instructions to a computer** to perform computational tasks, implement logic, calculations, conditions, loops, and complex algorithms.

## Key Characteristics:
- **Computational Logic**: Contains control structures (if/else, loops, functions)
- **Data Manipulation**: Can store, process, and transform data
- **Problem Solving**: Designed to solve complex computational problems
- **Turing Complete**: Most programming languages are Turing complete (can solve any computable problem)
- **Execution**: Requires compilation or interpretation to run

### Core Features:
- **Variables & Data Types**
- **Control Structures** (conditionals, loops)
- **Functions/Methods**
- **Algorithms & Logic**
- **Error Handling**
- **Memory Management**

**Examples**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, Rust, Swift

# <span style="color:rgb(255, 123, 15)">Markup Languages</span>

A **markup language** is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content to structure and present data.

## Key Characteristics:
- **Structural Focus**: Concentrate on presentation and organization rather than executing instructions
- **No Logic**: No scope for computational logic like loops or conditions
- **Tag-Based**: Embed tags or annotations within text that are interpreted by software
- **Declarative**: Describe what content should look like, not how to process it
- **Static Structure**: Define document structure and formatting

**Examples**: HTML, XML, Markdown, LaTeX, YAML, JSON

# <span style="color:rgb(128, 255, 128)">Scripting Languages</span>

**Scripting languages** are a subset of programming languages designed to **automate tasks** and **glue together** existing programs or systems.

## Key Characteristics:
- **Interpreted**: No scope of compiler in scripting languages
- **Automation Focused**: Excel at automating repetitive tasks
- **Integration**: Often used to connect different software components
- **Rapid Development**: Faster to write and test than compiled languages
- **System Administration**: Common in DevOps and system management

**Examples**: Python, JavaScript, PowerShell, Bash, Perl, Ruby, PHP

*Note: Many modern "scripting" languages like Python are full-featured programming languages*

# <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 80)">Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)</span>

Domain-specific languages are computer languages specialized to a particular application domain, in contrast to general-purpose languages which are broadly applicable across domains.

## Types of DSLs:

### Query Languages
- **SQL**: Database queries and management
- **GraphQL**: API data fetching
- **XPath**: XML document navigation

### Styling Languages
- **CSS**: Web page styling and layout
- **SASS/LESS**: Enhanced CSS with programming features

### Configuration Languages
- **YAML**: Configuration files and data serialization
- **TOML**: Configuration file format
- **JSON**: Data interchange format

### Template Languages
- **Jinja2**: Python templating
- **Mustache**: Logic-less templates
- **Liquid**: Template language for web apps

**Examples**: HTML, CSS, SQL - languages made for specific domains

# <span style="color:rgb(192, 192, 192)">Language Classification Summary</span>

| Type | Purpose | Logic | Execution | Examples |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Programming** | Solve computational problems | ✅ Full logic support | Compiled/Interpreted | Python, Java, C++, JavaScript |
| **Scripting** | Automate tasks & integration | ✅ Full logic support | Interpreted | Python, Bash, PowerShell |
| **Markup** | Structure & present data | ❌ No computational logic | Parsed/Rendered | HTML, XML, Markdown |
| **Domain-Specific** | Solve specific domain problems | ⚠️ Limited/Domain logic | Varies | SQL, CSS, YAML |

# <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 0)">Modern Considerations</span>

## Blurred Boundaries
- **CSS**: Traditional markup, but now has variables, functions, and logic
- **SQL**: Domain-specific, but increasingly supports programming constructs
- **JavaScript**: Started as scripting, now a full-stack programming language
- **Python**: General-purpose programming language also widely used for scripting

## Current Trends (2024-2025):
- JavaScript, Python and SQL are highly-desired and admired programming languages
- Rust continues to be the most-admired programming language with an 83% score
- Python continues to cement its overall dominance, buoyed by popular libraries for AI
- TypeScript gaining popularity for large-scale JavaScript applications
- WebAssembly enabling multiple languages to run in browsers

## Evolution of Language Roles:
Modern development often combines multiple language types:
- **HTML/CSS** for structure and styling
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** for interactivity
- **Python/Java/C++** for backend logic
- **SQL** for data management
- **YAML/JSON** for configuration
