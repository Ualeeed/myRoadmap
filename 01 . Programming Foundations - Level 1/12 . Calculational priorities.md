#### **Operator precedence**
determines how operators are parsed concerning each other, with operations having a higher precedence being performed before operations with lower precedence. This mathematical rule of precedence is also applicable in programming.

## Arithmetic Operator Precedence (BODMAS/PEMDAS)

BODMAS tells us which order to perform a calculation in: Brackets first then Order then Division then Multiplication then Addition and finally Subtraction.

| Priority | Operator Type | Symbol | Arabic Translation | Example |
|----------|---------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 (Highest) | **B**rackets | `( )` | الأقواس | `(2 + 3) * 4 = 20` |
| 2 | **O**rder (Powers/Roots) | `^`, `**`, `√` | الجذر والأس | `2^3 = 8` |
| 3 | **D**ivision & **M**ultiplication | `/`, `*` | القسمة والضرب | `6 / 2 * 3 = 9` |
| 4 (Lowest) | **A**ddition & **S**ubtraction | `+`, `-` | الجمع والطرح | `5 + 3 - 2 = 6` |

### Key Rules:
- Operations of the same precedence are performed from left to right
- Following BODMAS: `2 + 3 * 4 = 2 + (3 * 4) = 14`, not `(2 + 3) * 4 = 20`

## Programming Language Precedence

In most programming languages, arithmetic operators take precedence over logical operators, with the following order:
1. Arithmetic operators (** is highest, then */,  then +-)
2. Relational/Comparison operators
3. Logical operators (done last)

## Logical Operator Precedence

The order of precedence for logical operators is:
1. **NOT** (`!`, `¬`) - performed first
2. **AND** (`&&`, `∧`) - performed next  
3. **OR** (`||`, `∨`) - performed last

### Logical Operations Examples:

#### Example 1: Mixed Logical Operations
```
NOT True AND False OR True
```
**Step-by-step evaluation:**
1. `NOT True` = `False` (NOT has highest precedence)
2. `False AND False` = `False` (AND comes next)
3. `False OR True` = `True` (OR comes last)

**Result: `True`**

#### Example 2: Complex Expression
```
True AND ((9 > 2) OR (4+2 = 5))
```
**Step-by-step evaluation:**
1. `9 > 2` = `True` (arithmetic first, then comparison)
2. `4+2` = `6`, then `6 = 5` = `False`
3. `True OR False` = `True` (inside parentheses)
4. `True AND True` = `True`

**Result: `True`**

## Programming Examples

### C/C++ Precedence
In C++, expressions are parsed according to precedence rules where operators with higher precedence bind tighter to their arguments.

```c
// Without parentheses: follows precedence rules
result = a + b * c;  // Equivalent to: a + (b * c)

// With parentheses: overrides precedence
result = (a + b) * c;  // Forces addition first
```

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
// Arithmetic precedence
let x = 2 + 3 * 4;     // Result: 14 (not 20)

// Logical precedence  
let y = true && false || true;  // Result: true
// Evaluated as: (true && false) || true = false || true = true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Parentheses for Clarity**: Even when precedence rules apply, parentheses make code more readable
2. **Know Your Language**: Different programming languages may have slight variations in precedence
3. **Test Complex Expressions**: Always verify the result of complex expressions with multiple operators
4. **Left-to-Right Rule**: When operators have equal precedence, they are evaluated left to right

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: Assuming `2 + 3 * 4 = 20`
✅ **Correct**: `2 + 3 * 4 = 14` (multiplication first)

❌ **Wrong**: Assuming `!true && false = false`  
✅ **Correct**: `!true && false = false && false = false` (NOT first)

## Summary
Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct programs and avoiding calculation errors. There can only ever be one correct answer when precedence rules are properly followed, making it essential to master these concepts for programming success.
