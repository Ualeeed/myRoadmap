## What is a Computer?

#### **A computer** 


is an electronic machine that takes data (input), processes it using a set of instructions (called a program), stores it, and produces information (output). Modern computers are complex systems made up of various interconnected components working together.

A computer consists of two main parts:

1. <span style="color:rgb(181, 75, 251)">Software</span> : Applications, Operating Systems, Programs...
2. <span style="color:rgb(181, 75, 251)">Hardware</span> : Physical components like CPU, RAM, Mouse, Keyboard, Screen...

## Five Main Units of a Computer System

A <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">computer</span> system is divided into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">five</span> main <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">units</span>:

### 1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Input Unit</span>
- Used to give data and instructions to the computer
- **Examples**: Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone, Scanner, Touchscreen, Camera

### 2. <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Output Unit</span>
- Displays the result of processing to the user
- **Examples**: Monitor, Printer, Speakers, Headphones

### 3. <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Memory Unit (Storage)</span>
- Stores data temporarily or permanently
- **Types**:
  - **Primary Memory** (RAM, Cache – fast but temporary)
  - **Secondary Memory** (Hard Disk, SSD, NVMe – permanent storage)
- **Current Standards (2025)**:
  - For gaming PCs: 16-32 GB RAM is ideal
  - For workstations: 32-64 GB RAM recommended
  - DDR5 RAM is becoming mainstream, DDR6 arriving in 2025

### 4. <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Control Unit (CU)</span>
- Directs the flow of data and instructions inside the computer
- Acts like a **traffic controller** that manages everything
- Part of the CPU that coordinates all computer operations

### 5. <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</span>
- Performs all calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handles logic operations (comparisons like greater, smaller, equal)
- Works together with the Control Unit as part of the CPU

## Modern Computer Components (2025 Update)

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions
- **Current Trends**: Multi-core processors (4-16+ cores), advanced architectures
- 2nd generation 3nm technology reduces power by 50% and improves performance by 30%

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Handles visual processing and gaming graphics
- Increasingly used for AI computations and parallel processing
- Next-generation cards delivering higher frame rates and better resolution

### Motherboard
- Houses the CPU, memory, and connects all components
- Includes CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots (PCIe)
- Provides power distribution and connectivity

### Storage Evolution
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Fast, no moving parts, becoming standard
- **NVMe SSDs**: Fastest storage, directly connected to motherboard
- **HDD**: Traditional drives still used for large storage needs

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- Converts AC power to DC power for components
- Efficiency and power management increasingly important in 2025

### Cooling Systems
- Air cooling (fans) or liquid cooling
- Essential for maintaining performance and preventing overheating

## Software Components

### Operating System (OS)
- **Examples**: Windows 11, macOS, Linux
- Manages hardware resources and provides user interface

### Applications/Programs
- System software (drivers, utilities)
- Application software (games, productivity tools, browsers)

### Firmware (BIOS/UEFI)
- Low-level software that initializes hardware during startup

## 2025 Technology Trends

- **Performance Focus**: Higher frame rates, better resolution scaling
- **Efficiency Improvements**: DDR6, RISC-V, Wi-Fi 7 technologies
- **Memory Standards**: 32GB RAM becoming recommended for best performance
- **Upcoming Technologies**: Intel Panther Lake, AMD Zen 6, NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs
