# Programming Operators - Complete Guide

Operators are symbols that represent some kind of operation, such as mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical computations, which are to be performed on values or variables. The values and variables used with operators are called **operands**.

##  1. Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations:

| Operator         | Symbol | Example | Result | Description                    |
| ---------------- | :----: | :-----: | :----: | ------------------------------ |
| Addition         |   +    |   5+3   |   8    | Adds two numbers               |
| Subtraction      |   -    |   5-3   |   2    | Subtracts second from first    |
| Multiplication   |   *    |   5*3   |   15   | Multiplies two numbers         |
| Division         |   /    |  15/3   |   5    | Divides first by second        |
| Modulo Division  |   %    |   7%3   |   1    | Returns remainder after division |
| Power/Exponent   |  ^ **  |  2^3    |   8    | Raises first number to power of second |

##  2. Assignment Operators

These operators assign values to variables:

| Operator | Symbol | Example | Equivalent | Description |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|-------------|
| Simple Assignment | = | x = 5 | x = 5 | Assigns value to variable |
| Add Assignment | += | x += 3 | x = x + 3 | Adds and assigns |
| Subtract Assignment | -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 | Subtracts and assigns |
| Multiply Assignment | *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 | Multiplies and assigns |
| Divide Assignment | /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 | Divides and assigns |

##  3. Increment/Decrement Operators

These operators are used to increment or decrement the value of a variable by 1.

| Operator       | Symbol | Example | Description                       |
| -------------- | :----: | :-----: | --------------------------------- |
| Pre-increment  |  ++x   | ++count | Increments first, then uses value |
| Post-increment |  x++   | count++ | Uses value first, then increments |
| Pre-decrement  |  --x   | --count | Decrements first, then uses value |
| Post-decrement |  x--   | count-- | Uses value first, then decrements |

**Example:**
```
x = 5
y = ++x  // x becomes 6, y = 6 (pre-increment)
z = x++  // z = 6, then x becomes 7 (post-increment)
```

##  4. Relational/Comparison Operators

Relational operators check the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

| Operator                | Symbol | Example | Result | Description |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :-----: | :----: | ----------- |
| Equal to                |   ==   |  5==7   | False  | Tests equality |
| Not equal to            |   !=   |  5!=7   | True   | Tests inequality |
| Less than               |   <    |  5<7    | True   | Tests if left is smaller |
| Greater than            |   >    |  5>7    | False  | Tests if left is larger |
| Less than or equal to   |   <=   |  5<=7   | True   | Tests if left ≤ right |
| Greater than or equal to|   >=   |  5>=7   | False  | Tests if left ≥ right |

##  5. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. They are used in decision making.

| Operator | Symbol | Example | Result | Description |
| -------- | :----: | :-----: | :----: | ----------- |
| Logical AND | && | true && false | false | Returns true only if both operands are true |
| Logical OR | \|\| | true \|\| false | true | Returns true if at least one operand is true |
| Logical NOT | ! | !true | false | Reverses the logical state |

### Truth Tables:

**AND Operator:**
- true AND true = true
- true AND false = false  
- false AND true = false
- false AND false = false

**OR Operator:**
- true OR true = true
- true OR false = true
- false OR true = true
- false OR false = false

**NOT Operator:**
- NOT true = false
- NOT false = true

## ⚡ 6. Bitwise Operators

These operators are used to perform bit-level operations on operands. The most common bitwise operators are AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).

| Operator | Symbol | Example | Description |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|-------------|
| Bitwise AND | & | 5 & 3 | Performs AND on each bit |
| Bitwise OR | \| | 5 \| 3 | Performs OR on each bit |
| Bitwise XOR | ^ | 5 ^ 3 | Performs XOR on each bit |
| Bitwise NOT | ~ | ~5 | Inverts all bits |
| Left Shift | << | 5 << 1 | Shifts bits left |
| Right Shift | >> | 5 >> 1 | Shifts bits right |
1. Bitwise AND (&)

```
5 & 3 = 1

Binary representation:
5 = 101
3 = 011
--- (AND)
1 = 001
```

Each bit position: 1&1=1, 0&1=0, 1&1=1 → Result: 1 

2. Bitwise OR (|)

```
5 | 3 = 7

Binary representation:
5 = 101
3 = 011
--- (OR)
7 = 111
```

Each bit position: 1|1 = 1, 0|1 = 1, 1| = 1 → Result: 7 

3. Bitwise XOR (^)

```
5 ^ 3 = 6

Binary representation:
5 = 101
3 = 011
--- (XOR)
6 = 110
```

Each bit position: 1^1 =0, 0^1 =1, 1^1 =0 → Result: 6 

4. Bitwise NOT (~)

```
~5 = -6 (in most systems using two's complement)

Binary representation (8-bit example):
5  = 00000101
~5 = 11111010 = -6 in two's complement
```

5. Left Shift (<<)

```	
5 << 1 = 10

Binary representation:
5      = 101
5 << 1 = 1010 = 10
```

Shifts all bits one position to the left (equivalent to multiplying by 2)

6. Right Shift (>>)

```
5 >> 1 = 2

Binary representation:
5      = 101
5 >> 1 = 10 = 2
```

Shifts all bits one position to the right (equivalent to integer division by 2)

##  7. Operator Precedence

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

**Precedence Order (highest to lowest):**
1. **Unary operators:** ++, --, !, ~, unary +, unary -
2. **Multiplicative:** *, /, %
3. **Additive:** +, -
4. **Relational:** <, <=, >, >=
5. **Equality:** ==, !=
6. **Logical AND:** &&
7. **Logical OR:** ||
8. **Assignment:** =, +=, -=, *=, /=

**Example:**
```
2 + 3 * 4 = 2 + 12 = 14  (not 20)
```

##  8. Operator Classification by Operands

On the basis of the number of operands they work on, operators can be classified into three types:

- **Unary Operators:** Work on single operand (++, --, !, ~)
- **Binary Operators:** Work on two operands (+, -, *, /, ==, &&)  
- **Ternary Operator:** Works on three operands (condition ? value1 : value2)

##  Key Programming Concepts

1. **Operands:** The values or variables that operators work with
2. **Expressions:** Combinations of operators and operands
3. **Evaluation:** The process of calculating the result of an expression
4. **Side Effects:** Changes to program state (like with increment operators)
