# Network Fundamentals

A **network** is a group of <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">interconnected computers</span> and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">devices</span> that can communicate and share resources with each other.

## Core Network Components

### What Makes a Network?
- **Devices**: Computers, smartphones, tablets, printers, servers
- **Connections**: Physical cables or wireless signals
- **Protocols**: Rules that govern how devices communicate
- **Hardware**: Routers, switches, access points

## Types of Networks by Coverage Area

### 🏠 LAN (Local Area Network)



**Characteristics**:
- Connects nearby devices (same building or campus)
- High-speed, low-latency communication
- Covers smallest area such as colleges, schools, hospitals
- Can range from a few devices (home network) to hundreds (enterprise network)
- Private ownership and control

**Connection Methods**:

1. **Wired Connections**
   - Uses **Ethernet** cables (twisted pair, fiber optic)
   - Ethernet is the most widely used LAN protocol
   - Faster and more secure than wireless
   - No mobility limitations

2. **Wireless Connections (WLAN)**
   - Uses **Wi-Fi** (Wireless Fidelity) technology
   - WLANs use radio frequency (RF) technology to transmit and receive data over the air
   - 802.11be (or WiFi 7) started rolling out in 2024, offering even better range
   - Provides mobility within coverage area

### 🌐 WAN (Wide Area Network)



**Characteristics**:
- Connects LANs across large geographical distances
- Spans cities, countries, or continents  
- Uses public telecommunications infrastructure
- Higher latency due to distance
- The Internet is the largest example of a WAN

**Modern WAN Technologies**:
- WAN-as-a-service is a cloud-based WAN model
- MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
- VPN (Virtual Private Networks)
- Fiber optic connections

### 🏙️ Other Network Types

**MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
- Covers a city or metropolitan area
- Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN
- Often used by ISPs and large organizations

**PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
- Very small network around an individual
- Examples: Bluetooth connections, USB connections
- Range typically under 10 meters

## Network Protocols (Communication Rules)

### Essential Protocols

1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**
   - The most common protocol is TCP/IP
   - Foundation of internet communication
   - Ensures reliable data delivery

2. **Ethernet Protocol**
   - Responsible for physical transmission of data over network hardware
   - Standard for wired LAN communication
   - Defines how data travels over cables

3. **Wi-Fi Standards (IEEE 802.11)**
   - Specifies protocols for implementing wireless local area network communication
   - Different versions: 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)

4. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
   - Used for different types of communication alongside TCP/IP
   - Faster but less reliable than TCP
   - Good for streaming and gaming

## Network Security Basics

You can secure both LANs and WANs by using various methods such as firewalls, encryption, and access control

### Security Methods:
- **Firewalls**: Control network traffic
- **Encryption**: Scramble data during transmission
- **Access Control**: Limit who can connect
- **VPNs**: Create secure tunnels over public networks

## Key Differences: Wired vs Wireless

| Aspect | Ethernet (Wired) | Wi-Fi (Wireless) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Speed** | Generally faster | Improving with new standards |
| **Security** | More secure | Requires encryption |
| **Mobility** | Fixed and usually stationary | Offers mobility and flexibility |
| **Reliability** | Very stable | Can have interference |
| **Setup** | Requires cables | Easy setup, no cables |
