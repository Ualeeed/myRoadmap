## <span style="color:rgb(20, 192, 255)">Variables</span>

Variables are fundamental elements in programming, serving as named storage locations to hold and manipulate data. They are containers for storing data values that can be changed during program execution.

### Variable Declaration Components
When you declare a variable like `int age = 45`, you create:
- **Type**: `int` (specifies what kind of data can be stored)
- **Identifier**: `age` (the name used to reference the variable)
- **Value**: `45` (the actual data stored)
- **Memory Location**: A cell in RAM where the data is physically stored

| Memory Cell |
| ----------- |
|     45      |
|    (age)    |

### Variable Types (Data Types)

#### 1. Numeric Types
- **Integer** (`int`): Stores whole numbers without decimal points
  - Examples: `0, 123, -456, 1998`
  - Memory usage varies by system (typically 4 bytes)

- **Float** (`float`): Used to store single precision floating-point values
  - Examples: `5.2, 3.6, 12.3`
  - Precision: ~7 decimal digits

- **Double** (`double`): Stores double precision floating-point numbers
  - Higher precision than float (~15-17 decimal digits)
  - Examples: `3.14159265359, 1998.123456789`

#### 2. Text Type
- **String**: A sequence of character data types that can include both upper and lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation
  - Examples: `"Walid", "Morocco", "Hello World!"`
  - Enclosed in double quotes in most languages

#### 3. Boolean Type
- **Boolean** (`bool`): Has only two possible values: true and false
  - Used to show logic in code
  - Represents one bit of information
  - Examples: `true, false`

### Variable Naming Rules
A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits and underscore. The first letter should be either a letter or an underscore.

**Valid Examples**: `age`, `userName`, `_count`, `student2`
**Invalid Examples**: `2student`, `user-name`, `class@room`

## Constants
A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. Constant variables are immutable after their definition and can be initialized only once in the whole program.

### Constant Declaration
```cpp
const float PI = 3.14159;
const int MAX_STUDENTS = 50;
const string SCHOOL_NAME = "Programming Academy";
```

### Key Differences: Variables vs Constants

| Aspect | Variables | Constants |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Mutability** | Can be changed | Cannot be changed after initialization |
| **Keyword** | No special keyword | `const` keyword required |
| **Naming Convention** | camelCase or snake_case | UPPER_CASE (recommended) |
| **Memory** | Value can be overwritten | Value is fixed in memory |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic data | Fixed values like PI, configuration settings |

### Benefits of Using Constants
1. **Code Safety**: Make variables constant whenever possible
2. **Readability**: Makes code self-documenting
3. **Maintenance**: Easy to update values in one place
4. **Performance**: Compiler optimizations possible

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive names for both variables and constants
- Initialize variables when declaring them when possible
- Use constants for values that should never change
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Choose appropriate data types for memory efficiency
